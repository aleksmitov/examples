"""Titanic Survival Project Example

This file demonstrates how we can develop and train our model by using the
`passenger_features` we've developed earlier. Every ML model project
should have a definition file like this one.

    This function is a reserved function and will be called by Layer
    when we want this model to be trained along with the parameters.
    Just like the `passenger_features` featureset, you can add more
    parameters to this method to request artifacts (datasets,
    featuresets or models) from Layer.

    Args:
        context (layer.Context): Represents the current context of the model, passed by
            Layer when the training of the model starts.
        pf (layer.Featureset): Layer will return a Featureset object,
            an interface to access the features inside the
            `passenger_features`

    Returns:
       model: Trained model object
